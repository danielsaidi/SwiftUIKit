# SwiftUIKit

SwiftUIKit is a library that adds extra functionality to Swift and SwiftUI. It contains additional components, a lot of extensions to native types, and much more.

SwiftUIKit can kickstart your development and solves many tricky problems.



## Installation

SwiftUIKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit.git
```


## Support My Work

You can [become a sponsor][Sponsors] to help me dedicate more time on my various [open-source tools][OpenSource]. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference in keeping these tools free and actively developed.



## Getting Started

SwiftUIKit started small, but has grown big over the years. Due to its complexity, I decided to remove the demo. Instead, have a look at the various namespaces and use the live previews to explore the SDK.

I will extract parts of this project into separate libraries, to provide better documentation & help. Have a look at [my open-source listing page][OpenSource] for some of these.



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has more information, code examples, etc.
