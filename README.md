## About SwiftUIKit

SwiftUIKit is a Swift SDK that adds extra functionality to `SwiftUI` and `Swift`. It contains additional components, a lot of extensions to native types, and much more. 

SwiftUIKit can kickstart your development and solves many tricky problems.



## Installation

SwiftUIKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit.git
```



## Getting Started

SwiftUIKit started as a small project, but has grown pretty huge over the years.

Due to its complexity, I have decided to remove the demo. Instead, have a look at the various namespaces and use the live previews to explore the components in the SDK.

I will therefore extract parts of this SDK into separate libraries, to be able to provide better documentation & help. 

For more Swift & SwiftUI SDKs that I have created, please have a look at [my open-source listing page][OpenSource].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has more information, code examples, etc.



## Support my work 

You can [sponsor me][Sponsors] on GitHub Sponsors or [reach out][Email] for paid support, to help support my [open-source projects][OpenSource].

Your support makes it possible for me to put more work into these projects and make them the best they can be.
