## About SwiftUIKit

`SwiftUIKit` adds extra functionality to `SwiftUI`, like extensions to existing types and completely new views, pickers, utilites, services etc. 

`SwiftUIKit` is divided into these areas:

* Blurs
* Cameras
* Data
* Extensions
* Gestures
* Navigation
* Pickers
* Presentation
* Sharing
* Styles
* Views

You can explore the various sections in the demo app.


## Demo App

This project contains a demo app that lets you explore `SwiftUIKit` through interactive demos. 

The demo app provides an intuitive way to explore the library. Together with the extensive documentation and SwiftUI previews, I hope you'll find it easy to understand how the various parts of the library works.

To run the demo app, just open and run the `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj` project. It's a universal app project, but the `macOS` app is currenty not working that well. 


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit.git
```

### CocoaPods

```
pod DSSwiftUIKit
```

Note that you have to use `import DSSwiftUIKit` when you use CocoaPods. The name `SwiftUIKit` was (not surprisingly) already taken.
