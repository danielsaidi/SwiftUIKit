/**
 This context can be used to present sheets in a dynamic way.
 
 To use this class, just create a `@StateObject` instance in
 your presenting view and bind the context to that view:
 
 ```swift
 struct MyView: View {
 
     @StateObject var context = SheetContext()
 
     var body: some View {
         Button("Show sheet") {
             context.present(Text("Hello, world!"))
         }
         .sheet(context)
     }
 }
 ```
 
 This view modifier will also inject the provided context as
 an environment object into the view hierarchy, to let other
 views in the same view hierarchy reuse the same context.

 This key can be used to keep track of the currently focused
 context within a multi-window app.

 To apply it to a view, just use the `focusedValue` modifier
 with your context instance:

 ```swift
 .focusedValue(\.sheetContext, context)
 ```

 To access the focus value, e.g. in a menu command, just use
 the `@FocusedValue` property wrapper:

 ```swift
 @FocusedValue(\.sheetContext)
 private var sheetContext: SheetContext?
 ```
