/// To use this class, just create a `@StateObject` instance
/// in your presenting view and bind the context to the view:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyView: View {
///
///     @StateObject var context = FullScreenCoverContext()
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Show cover") {
///             context.present(Text("Hello, world!"))
///         }
///         .fullScreenCover(context)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This view modifier will also inject the provided context
/// as an environment object into the view hierarchy, to let
/// other views in the same hierarchy reuse the same context.

/**
 This key can be used to keep track of the currently focused
 context within a multi-window app.

 To apply it to a view, just use the `focusedValue` modifier
 with your context instance:

 ```swift
 .focusedValue(\.fullscreenCoverContext, context)
 ```

 To access the focus value, e.g. in a menu command, just use
 the `@FocusedValue` property wrapper:

 ```swift
 @FocusedValue(\.fullscreenCoverContext)
 var fullscreenCoverContext: FullscreenCoverContext?
 ```
